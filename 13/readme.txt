Part 2 takes a long time to run, there's probably a more elegant way to deal with this
--found a solution online, figured out my solution was going to take ~180 days
--optimized by shifting largest number only - down to 33 days
--optimized by shifting two largest numbers - down to 16.5 days
--found pattern in combination of largest numbers  - figured out delta and offset and iterated through that - solution about 2 minutes
-minus 3/4 stars
